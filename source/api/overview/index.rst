Quick Start
===============

The eagle.io API conforms to the design principles of `Representational State Transfer (REST) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer>`_.

Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.
