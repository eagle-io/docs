Versioning
------------

The API version number is specified as part of the URL.
**v1** is the currently supported version and has a base URL::

    https://eagle.io/api/v1/

As we make updates and additions to the eagle.io API, we will only make changes, add new features and/or implement fixes to the current released API that do not affect backward compatibility.

.. note::
    API v1 is still in *BETA* and subject to minor changes until the final stable release (scheduled for November 2014).
