Scheduled
	Enable the schedule for automatic data collection. You should Disable the schedule when using the TCP Callback Transport for event based callbacks (ie. not permanently connected).

Schedule type
	*Server* is the recommended option for always connected devices and allows easy schedule configuration.

	*Remote* enables a *Scout modem* to maintain its own schedule allowing for low power mode and customised configuration.

Collection interval
	Select the frequency of the collection.

Interval offset
	Offset the collection interval to prevent collection occuring on the interval. eg. 1 hour collection interval will occur at 9am, 10am, etc. Set an interval offset of 5 minutes and the collection times will be 9:05am, 10:05am, etc.
