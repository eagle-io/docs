Acquire
=======
|icon-datasource-acquire| Acquire performs a one-time collection on the Source(s) chosen. View the current operation status from the Source List View. Requires *operate* permission.

When acquiring from a Source that uses a *Scout modem* you may be prompted to confirm the remote connection.
This occurs when the Source Schedule is *Disabled* or set to *Remote* (ie. device not permanently connected). An SMS will be sent to the *Scout modem* to initiate a callback. The account owner will be charged for the SMS at the standard SMS Notification rate applicable to their account type. Read more about :ref:`Scout configuration <device-scout>`.

*Scout modem remote connection confirmation*
