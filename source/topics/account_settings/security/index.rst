.. _management-security-administrators:

Administrators
---------------

Administrators have full access to your account including unrestricted access to all Workspaces and most configuration settings for the account. There is no need to explicitly :ref:`Share a Workspace <node-configuration-workspace-security>` with any Administrators of the same account.
If you would like a user to have restricted access to Workspaces, then *do not* add them as Administrators. Instead use :ref:`Workspace Sharing <node-configuration-workspace-security>` to add them as a User of a Workspace with an assigned role.

Add a new administrators by entering their email addresses and click *Add*. Separate multiple email addresses with a comma. Remove administrators by clicking the trash icons. Click *Save* to confirm.

.. _management-security-groups:

Groups
---------

Groups are used to organize your users and provide a convenient way to manage :ref:`Workspace access <node-configuration-workspace-security>` and :ref:`notifications <notifications>`. 
To use groups, simply click *Add group*, assign a unique name and enter the email address of user(s) that you want to include in the group. 
New users will receive a welcome email with links to setup their user profile and login. A user can be assigned to more than one group. 

After saving the newly created group, you can proceed to :ref:`share workspace access <node-configuration-workspace-security>` and :ref:`manage notifications <notifications-manage>`.

You can now add/remove users to the group and they will automatically receive/lose Workspace access and notifications associated with the group.

.. _management-security-apikeys:

API keys
----------

API keys are used to authenticate eagle.io HTTP API requests. The API keys section allows you to create, delete or modify the permissions for API keys associated with your user account. You can have multiple API keys active at once.

API resource requests are always restricted to Workspaces in the associated account. Individual API keyâ€™s can optionally be assigned the *Read only* permission to restrict the actions an API request can perform (GET requests only). 
You can also set the access level to *Limited workspaces* and check all the Workspaces this API key is allowed to access.
