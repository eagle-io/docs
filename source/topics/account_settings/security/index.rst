Administrators
---------------

Administrators have full access to your account including unrestricted access to all Workspaces and most configuration settings for the account. There is no need to explicitly :ref:`Share a Workspace <node-configuration-workspace-security>` with any Administrators of the same account.
If you would like a user to have restricted access to Workspaces, then *do not* add them as Administrators. Instead use :ref:`Workspace Sharing <node-configuration-workspace-security>` to add them as a User of a Workspace with an assigned role.

Add a new administrators by entering their email addresses and click *Add*. Separate multiple email addresses with a comma. Remove administrators by clicking the trash icons. Click *Save* to confirm.

API keys
----------

API keys are used to authenticate eagle.io HTTP API requests. The API keys section allows you to create, delete or modify the permissions for API keys associated with your user account. You can have multiple API keys active at once.

API resource requests are always restricted to Workspaces in the associated account. Individual API keyâ€™s can optionally be assigned the *Read only* permission to restrict the actions an API request can perform (GET requests only). 
You can also set the access level to *Limited workspaces* and check all the Workspaces this API key is allowed to access.
