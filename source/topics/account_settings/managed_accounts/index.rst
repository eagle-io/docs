Managed accounts
===================

|icon-users| Managed accounts are new accounts you have created for end-clients or your own company departments to segregate assets and users but retain full management functionality and centralized billing.

Administrators of your account automatically inherit administrator access to all managed accounts. 

.. note::
    Trial accounts and users of managed accounts do not have access to the *managed accounts* section.

Trials
---------

Create managed trials to provide clients with a 30 day free evaluation of the service at no charge to you.

Managed trials are displayed in the list with their status initially set to *ACTIVE* and become *DISABLED* on expiry.
Use the dropdown menu to *Switch to account*, *Request extension*, *Upgrade to paid* or *Close account*. 

Disabled trial accounts will be automatically removed 3 months after expiry.

Click the *New trial* button to create a new trial account. 
Specify the *account name* and *account owner email* address.

You can optionally send a welcome email to the account owner. 
If the user has never logged-in to the system, the welcome email will contain a link to activate their user profile. You can skip the welcome email if you want to customize the account first, then use the *resend invite* option from the account list when ready (only available if the user has never logged-in).

Sample workspace content can also be added when the account is created. You should ensure you remove any demonstration datasources prior to upgrading a trial to a paid account to prevent being charged usage fees for this content.

.. note::
    The *account owner email* address can only be assigned as the account owner of one account.

Accounts
---------

Create managed accounts to provide your clients with their own domain and logo customization. You will be responsible for all charges incurred by the managed accounts while they are active.

Managed accounts are displayed in the list with their status initially set to *ACTIVE*. 
Use the dropdown menu to *Switch to account*, *Disable*, *Enable* or *Close account*. You can disable an account and re-enable it at any time. You will not be charged usage fees for the duration the account is disabled but new data will not be collected until the account has been re-enabled.
