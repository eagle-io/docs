Intercom 
--------


`Intercom <http://www.intercom.com>`_ is a third-pary provider which offers a range of products for sales, marketing and support to connect with customers

The Intercom intergration for eagle.io allows you to provide support to your users via a custom chat messenger, or "bubble", embedded in eagle.io. It also provides insights into user activity on the platform.

.. note:: 
    Your custom Intercom chat bubble will only display on your custom eagle.io domain.

To connect with Intercom, you need to provide eagle.io with your Intercom **App ID** and **Identity Verification Secret**. You also need to have enabled Identity Verification for your Intercom account.

Your **App ID** is found in the URL when logged into your Intercom account:

Once enabled, your custom Intercom bubble is only visible to non admin users who access eagle.io from your custom domain. Admin users will still see the standard eagle.io Intercom bubble.

To display your custom Intercom bubble to admin users as well, select your account name in the administrator support handler settings as shown below:
