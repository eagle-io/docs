Troubleshooting
===============

The interface is not displaying correctly or does not appear to be up to date
	Try clearing your browser cache, refresh the page and ensure you are using the latest version of a supported web browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari. Some browser addons or plugins are known to degrade performance and should be disabled when using Eagle.io.

	We recommend `Google Chrome <https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/>`_ for the best Eagle.io experience.



Uploading attachment failed
	Ensure you have a stable internet connection and retry. Some camera phones generate large files which may be time consuming to upload. 

Location Nodes dont expand to show their contained Nodes in the Workspaces Menu
	You must have *configure* permission on the workspace to see Nodes contained within Locations from the Workspaces Menu. You can still use List View - Sources, Parameters and Attachments Subviews to review the status of the corresponding Node types.

Context Menu not displayed or has limited options
	Most context menu items require certain Workspace permissions. If there are no context menu items available to the user then no context menu will be displayed.
