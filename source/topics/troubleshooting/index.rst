Debug logging
-------------

If you are experiencing intermittent bugs or other software related issues, our software development team may instruct you to use our in-built *debug logging* feature.
This will temporarily capture user interactions and other eagle.io specific information which will assist our team to find and fix the problem. 

To use this feature:

1. Open the *Support request* dialog from the navigation bar and click the *Start debug logging* button. 
2. Close the dialog (or refresh browser) and perform the interactions/navigation steps needed to reproduce the issue. 
3. Re-open the *Support request* dialog and click the *Stop debug logging* button.
4. If any critical data has been captured, a log file will be automatically saved to your device.
5. Email the log file (along with a description of the issue) to support@eagle.io
