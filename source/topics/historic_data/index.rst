Historic Data
==============

|icon-history| Historic data is always associated with an individual Node.
You can store millions of individual data points per parameter. This may include high-resolution millisecond data or historic records from the past 100 years. 

Data is always stored in a raw unprocessed format with optional quality information. 
You can display and export the data in tabular or chart format via the user interface in either raw or processed format. 

You can also use the eagle.io :ref:`HTTP API <api>` for importing or extracting data.

Use :ref:`historic aggregates <historic-aggregates>` to process the raw data and apply specific calculations for statistical analysis.
