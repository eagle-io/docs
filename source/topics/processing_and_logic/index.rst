Processing and Logic
====================

Processing and Logic provides a programming environment to perform calculations, make decisions and take actions.

Some examples include:

- transform a series using an equation
- alarm based on mutiple parameter values
- generate a series forecast to provide predictive alarming

Programs are expressed as JavaScript, stored as configuration in Process Nodes, and executed on a schedule or as new data is acquired. Each program can access any Node within a Workspace and it's associated time-series data.

Process Nodes
-------------
There are two types...

Process Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[screenshot of code window showing single return statement]
first input provides timestamps, must return a single value etc.

Processor
~~~~~~~~~
[screenshot of code window showing multiple functions and outputs]
[screenshot of output parameters generated from code]
timestamps are generated by schedule or first input
provides mutliple outputs

Process Alarm
-------------
how its raised, when its cleared

Errors
------

Compilation Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runtime Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
