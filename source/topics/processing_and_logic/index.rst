Processing and Logic
====================

Processing and Logic provides a programming environment to perform calculations, make decisions and take actions.

Some examples include:

- :ref:`Calculate average of multiple Parameters <example1>`
- :ref:`Transform a series using an equation <example2>`
- :ref:`Generate a series forecast to provide predictive alarming <example3>`

Programs are expressed as JavaScript, stored as configuration in Process Nodes, and executed on a schedule or as new data is acquired. Each program can interact with all Nodes in the current Workspace and any associated time-series data.

.. _process-nodes:

Process Nodes
-------------
There are two types of Nodes that can have a program defined as part of their configuration. The first is a Process Parameter; once a process is written and compiled in the configuration of a Parameter, it becomes a Process Parameter. The second is a special type of Data Source called a Processor.

.. _process-parameter:

|icon-point-number-range-process| Process Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Process Parameter can be any existing Parameter which has a process written and compiled in it's configuration. The process can refer to any other Parameters in the Workspace as inputs (even other Process Parameters). The first input that is referred to will be used to define the timestamps used by the output of the process. Each execution of the process must return a single output value. The number of new input values available since the last process execution will determine how many times the process will be executed. This cumulative output is then stored as the time-series values of the Process Parameter, and can then be viewed in the same way as any other Parameter (for example, it can be shown as a table or chart, exported, used as input for a different process, etc.). The output can also have states defined which will trigger alarms, in the same way as any regular Parameter. 


.. _processor:

|icon-datasource-processor| Processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Processor is a type of Data Source containing a process that generates multiple output values, which are stored as new Parameters. The timestamps of the output data can be generated by scheduling the execution of the process, in the same way that data acquisition of a regular Data Source can be scheduled. Alternatively, the timestamps can be defined by the first input, just as with Process Parameters. Another feature shared with Process Parameters is the ability to refer to any other Nodes in the Workspace as inputs. Note that as the Processor is a type of Data Source, it will contribute to the total number of Data Sources that are counted when billing the account.

.. _process-alarm:

Process Alarm
-------------
A Process Alarm is raised when a process encounters an error during execution. A subsequent successful compilation or execution of the process will clear the alarm.

Errors
------
The two general category of errors that can be encounted with Proccessing and Logic are compilation errors and runtime errors. 

Compilation Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Compilation errors are caused either by incorrect syntax or some other error condition that can be detected by the compiler. Compilation errors are experienced as immediate feedback when compiling a program, and contain a specific error message which can be used to remedy the problem. A successful compilation indicates there are no compilation errors. A program will not be executed until it can be compiled without errors.

Runtime Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Runtime errors can occur during the execution of a program even when it compiled successfully. For example, if an input node referenced by the program is deleted from the workspace, the program will no longer be able to run successfully. These types of errors will be expressed as process alarms, and will contain a specific error message to help remedy the problem. 

Best Practices
--------------
- Inputs should be declared before they are referenced, so that any line numbers in error messages will clearly refer to the declaration of a missing input.
- Very complex or time-consuming calculations may cause the process to exceed the allowed processing time limit. 
- **Any** input that is referenced by a process will trigger execution of the process when that input is updated. Therefore, a large number of inputs being updated frequently or on different schedules can trigger a process to run very frequently. For example, if 9 inputs are updated every hour, but the 10th input is updated every minute, then the process will execute every minute.
- As the first referenced input is used to determine the output timestamp for a Process Parameter, the input which updates most frequently should be the first input.


Examples
--------

.. _example1:

Calculate average of multiple Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. code-block:: javascript
    :linenos:

    // Calculate the average currentValue of Parameters from different Locations
    var param1 = NODE('Location 1/Source/Param').getCurrentValue();
    var param2 = NODE('Location 2/Source/Param').getCurrentValue();
    var param3 = NODE('Location 3/Source/Param').getCurrentValue();

    return (param1 + param2 + param3) / 3;

.. _example2:

Transform a series using an equation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript
    :linenos:

    // Transform the currentValue using a 3rd order polynomial
    var a = 7.24;
    var b = -10.004;
    var c = 4.328;
    var d = -0.4667;
    var v = THIS.getCurrentValue();

    return a + (b*v) + (c*v^2) + (d*v^3);
