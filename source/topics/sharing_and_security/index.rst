Sharing and Security
====================

Every interaction with the system is authenticated to ensure the user performing the interaction or operation has permission to do so. The :ref:`Events View <view-events>` provides an audit trail for all user interactions and system events.

The account owner can specify a list of :ref:`administrators <management-security-administrators>` that automatically receive unrestricted access to the account and its Workspaces. Only trusted users should be added as administrators.

Workspaces can be shared with anyone. Users new to eagle.io will receive an email notification prompting them to confirm their email address and configure their personal preferences. Select *Sharing* from the Workspace Node context menu to display the Sharing/Properties dialog.
See :ref:`Workspace Sharing <node-configuration-workspace-sharing>` for full details

.. note::
	Only Administrators or Workspace users with *security* permission have access to Sharing.


Workspace users are assigned a User Role specific to the Workspace which determines what interactions or operations the user is allowed to perform on that Workspace. The individual User Role permissions can be configured from :menuselection:`Account management --> Security --> User roles`. See :ref:`User Roles <management-security-userroles>` for full details.
