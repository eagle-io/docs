Annotations
============

Historic data can optionally contain annotations. 
Each data point in the time series can store a textual comment to provide users with additional context to the value or quality.

Annotations are visible on charts and tabular data and can be included in historic exports.

.. note:: The maximum length of an annotation is 500 characters.
